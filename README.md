# Slang-Intrerpreter

As part of my CSE 262: Programming Languages course at Lehigh University, I, along with my teammate, created a fully functional interpreter for a Scheme functional programming language subset that we called Slang. The only difference between Slang and Scheme is that Slang does not support some syntactic sugar expressions from Scheme such as let, let*, and letrec.
