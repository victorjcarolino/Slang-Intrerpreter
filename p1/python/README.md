# CSE 262 Assignment 1: Python

In this part of the assignment, you will write our five programs in Python. The
Python3 interpreter is available on the SunLab as `python3`, or you can install
it on your local machine.  Please make sure that your code is compatible with
the version of Python on the sunlab (v 3.9), which is fairly new, but lacks some
nice features added in Python 3.10.

If you are used to Java, Python may feel loose and unstructured, because you
rarely specify the types of variables.  In addition to a different syntax, as a
purely interpreted language, Python is able to offer some powerful features that
would be extremely complex to implement in other languages.

## Building and Running the Code

As a purely interpreted language, you can run python programs with invocations
like `python3 my_map.py`.

In truth, you will probably want to write some separate "driver" files that
`import` your solutions and test them.  Alternatively, you can read
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do> and think
about how to create a guard so that your tests will run if your file is invoked
directly from `python3`, but not if it is imported.

## Turn-In Details

You should do all of your work for this part of the assignment in the five
`.scm` files listed above.  When you have something worth turning in, you can
use a variation on this sequence of commands:

```bash
git add read_list.py
git commit -m "<your commit message here>"
git push
```

## Documentation Details

* In each file, you should comment your code extensively, to describe what it is
  doing.  This will be graded.  You should write your comments assuming that the
  audience is someone who has never programmed in Python before, but who knows
  Java well.  Be verbose!
