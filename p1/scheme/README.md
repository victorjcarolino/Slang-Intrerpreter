# CSE 262 Assignment 1: Scheme

In this part of the assignment, you will write our five programs in Scheme. The
"Gambit" Scheme interpreter is available on the SunLab as `gsi`, or you can
install it on your local machine.

Scheme's syntax is radically different than Java and Python, as is its
philosophy: You should think about recursion as much as possible!  You may want
to read Chapter 11 of the textbook to get some ideas about how to think like a
Scheme programmer and write idiomatic code.

## Building and Running the Code

Since `gsi` is an interpreter, you may find it hard to figure out how to run and
test your code.  My preference is to use the following process:

1. Write your code in the appropriate file
2. In `gsi`, type `(load "filename.scm")` to load your file
3. Then invoke your code to test it (e.g., `(define x (read-list)) (my-reverse x)`)

When you find bugs, you will probably need to exit your interpreter, fix the
code, and restart the interpreter.  You can use `ctrl-d` to exit the
interpreter.

## Turn-In Details

You should do all of your work for this part of the assignment in the five
`.scm` files listed above.  When you have something worth turning in, you can
use a variation on this sequence of commands:

```bash
git add read_list.scm
git commit -m "<your commit message here>"
git push
```

## Documentation Details

* In each file, you should comment your code extensively, to describe what it is
  doing.  This will be graded.  You should write your comments assuming that the
  audience is someone who has never programmed in Scheme before.  Be verbose!
