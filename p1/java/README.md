# CSE 262 Assignment 1: Java

In this part of the assignment, you will write our five programs in Java. The
Java Development Kit (JDK) is available on the SunLab as `javac` and `java`, or
you can install it on your local machine.

## Building and Running the Code

To simplify the build process, this code uses `gradle` to manage building.  To
build the program in a unix environment, you should be able to type:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

If there are no compilation errors, you should see something like this:

```bash
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 744ms
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed
```

You can run the program like this:

```bash
java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar
```

You should feel free to edit the `main` function in `App.java` so that it does
extensive testing of your solutions.

You can clean up intermediate files by typing:

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

## Turn-In Details

You should do all of your work for this part of the assignment in the five
`.java` files listed above.  When you have something worth turning in, you can
use a variation on this sequence of commands:

```bash
git add read_list.java
git commit -m "<your commit message here>"
git push
```

## Documentation Details

* In each file, you should comment your code extensively, to describe what it is
  doing.  This will be graded.  You should write your comments assuming that the
  audience is someone who has a CSE 17 level of familiarity with Java.  Be
  verbose!
